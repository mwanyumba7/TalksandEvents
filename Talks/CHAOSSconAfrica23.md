## Talk Title

### Building Trust in AI: The Importance of Explainability in Open Source Projects

## Abstract

Artificial Intelligence systems have become an integral part of modern technology and have the potential to revolutionise various industries. 
However, as AI systems become more complex and make decisions that affect human lives, building trust in AI is crucial. Explainability, the ability to understand how AI makes decisions, is a critical factor in building trust in AI. 
In this talk, we will discuss the importance of explainability in open-source AI projects and its impact on community health.
