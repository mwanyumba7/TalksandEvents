# Day One Exercises

## Loading Workbooks

1. Open the file `loading_workbooks.xlsx` from the Workbooks folder on your local computer.

2. On the worksheet `Google Monthly Stock Price`, select all values in column `C`.

3. How many rows are contained in column A including the header?

## Working with data

1. Create two new worksheets in our workbook, `Manual Input` and `Pasted Data`.

2. Navigate to the `Manual Input sheet`, and add the data from the table below. This should span three columns and four rows. I recommend starting from cell `A1`.

| Name | Age | Occupation |
|------|-----|------------|
| John | 32  | Developer  |
| Lisa | 28  | Designer   |
| Mike | 45  | Manager    |

3. Navigate to the other sheet you created earlier, `Pasted Data`.
    - Open the file `copying_data.xlsx` from the `data` folder. **Do not close any Excel workbook.**

4. Copy all data (columns `A` to `K`) from the `copying_data.xlsx` file and paste as values into your workbook.

5. The data looks messy; let's do some formatting to make the data easier to read.
    - Set the column width for all columns to 15.
    <details>
         To set the column width, highlight all the required columns by dragging from column A to column K. Next, right-click on the column letters and select column width. Here you can set the required width.
    </details>

    - Ensure all column headers begin with a capital letter and the rest of the column name is lowercase.

     <details>
        Re-type the column names by double-clicking the relevant cell.
    </details>


6. Question: **What was the runtime for the movie "The Shawshank Redemption" in minutes?**

## Creating Your First Formula

1. Navigate to the `Google Monthly Stock Price` sheet.

2. Create a new column next to `Volume` with the header name `Open vs Close`.
    - On the next row, subtract the value in the `Open` column from the `Close` column.

3. Copy the formula you created in the previous step to all rows in the sheet (to row 121).

4. Highlight all values in the column Open vs Close.

5. Question: **What was the average difference between the close and open price, rounded to two decimal places?**
