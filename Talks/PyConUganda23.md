## Talk Title

### Word Embeddings: A Pythonic Delight 

## Abstract

"Kenya is to Nairobi while Uganda is to___" You would immediately respond "Kampala" if I asked you to fill in the gap, even if I didn't give you a hint like "the answer is a capital city." Given what we now know, we can conclude that the answer is Kampala, the capital of Uganda, and that Kenya and Nairobi share a country-capital city link.

However, unless we explicitly tell computers so, they are unaware that Kampala is in the same "category" as Nairobi and other major cities. We would have to directly teach computers far too many things if we wanted them to comprehend human language as well as we do. Is there a better way?

Words are represented by a series of numbers when using word embeddings. This opens up a whole new world for computers since they can now utilize arithmetic and numbers, their native language, to understand the context of a phrase and infer links between words. In this talk We'll go into the specifics of word embeddings, including what they are, common word embedding algorithms, the issues they may be used to tackle, and how to use them with Python.
